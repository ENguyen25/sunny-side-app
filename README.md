# Sunny Side App

## Description
This app allows users to access weather conditions five days in advance for any city in the United States. It features a user-friendly search interface, aesthetic design, and a search history.

Through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to fetch data from the OneWeather API, and to display weather conditions dynamically. I learned how to store data to local storage.


## Installation
You can access the weather app at this website: https://enguyen25.github.io/sunny-side-app/.


## Usage
1. Enter the city name in the search bar. Click the search button. You will see weather conditions of the city, including 5 days in advance.

2. The city name will appear in your search history. Click the city name to see the weather conditions again.
