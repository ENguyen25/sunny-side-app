# Sunny Side App

## Description
This coding quiz challenge tests developers on their knowledge of coding and programming languages. I made this coding quiz to apply my JavaScript skills in creating basic interactive web-user interfaces.

Through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to make a responsive quiz that changes questions when you click an answer, saves your score, and matches your score with your initials. I also used jQuery to hide and show elements for a smooth user-interface.


## Installation
